## About

WP Ajax Search Widget is a replacement for the standard search widget. Instead of redirecting you to a new search page the results are returned underneath the search input with an option to click through to the standard results page.

The widget allows you to choose how many results to show.

## Hooks & Filters

The plugin has one filter that allows you adjust the search query parameters:

```
add_filter('wpasw_query', 'my_wp_query_array');
```

The plugin also has the following hooks for adding your own content at various points:

```
wpasw_before_widget
wpasw_after_widget

```

By placing the following template parts within a /parts/ folder in your theme you can also overwrite the HTML output:
